### 🔑 What are **Keys** in React?

**Keys** are special attributes used in React to help identify **which items in a list have changed, been added, or removed.**  
They are essential when rendering lists using `.map()`.

---

### ✅ **Why are keys important?**
- Help React **optimize rendering** and **maintain performance**.
- Prevent bugs when updating or reordering elements.
- Without keys, React re-renders the entire list unnecessarily.

---

### 🧠 **React needs a unique key for each element in a list**  
It’s **best** to use something **unique and constant**, like an `id`.

---

### ✅ **Example: Rendering a list with keys**

```jsx

```

---

### 🚫 What happens if you **don't use keys**?

- React will show a **warning** in the console.
- It may cause performance issues or **incorrect UI updates** when the list changes.

### 🟢 Summary:
| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔑 Key | Unique identifier for each element |
| 📈 Benefit | Optimized re-rendering |
| ❌ Bad Key | Using array index (only safe if list never changes) |
| ✅ Good Key | Use a stable, unique ID like `item.id` |
