A Higher-Order Component (HOC) in React is an advanced technique for reusing component logic. It's not a React API feature itself, but rather a pattern that emerges from React's compositional nature.

Definition:
A HOC is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component with enhanced functionality or props.

In simpler terms:

It's a function: const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
It takes a component (WrappedComponent) as input.
It returns a new component (EnhancedComponent).
The new component "wraps" the original component, adding shared logic, data, or behavior without modifying the original component itself.
