A Higher-Order Component (HOC) in React is an advanced technique for reusing component logic. It's not a React API feature itself, but rather a pattern that emerges from React's compositional nature.

Definition:
A HOC is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component with enhanced functionality or props.

In simpler terms:

It's a function: const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
It takes a component (WrappedComponent) as input.
It returns a new component (EnhancedComponent).
The new component "wraps" the original component, adding shared logic, data, or behavior without modifying the original component itself.

Where and Why Should it Be Used?

HOCs are useful for cross-cutting concerns â€“ functionalities that affect multiple components across an application. They promote:

Code Reusability: Instead of duplicating the same logic (like data fetching, authentication checks, logging, or state management) in various components, you centralize it in a HOC. This makes your codebase smaller and easier to maintain.
Why: Reduces redundancy, improves consistency.
Separation of Concerns: HOCs help keep your presentational components "dumb" and focused solely on rendering UI based on the props they receive. The logic for how those props are obtained or manipulated is abstracted away into the HOC.
Why: Makes components cleaner, more readable, and easier to test in isolation.
Prop Manipulation: HOCs can add, remove, or modify props passed to the wrapped component, enhancing its capabilities.
Why: Provides a flexible way to inject necessary data or behavior.
Conditional Rendering/Access Control: You can use HOCs to conditionally render a component based on certain criteria (e.g., user authentication status, feature flags, permissions).
Why: Centralizes authorization logic, preventing access to unauthorized content.
Performance Optimization (e.g., React.memo): While you might not write these yourself often, React.memo (a built-in HOC) is a prime example of a HOC used for performance optimization by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
Why: Improves application performance by memoizing components.
However, it's important to note:

With the introduction of React Hooks (starting from React 16.8), many use cases that were traditionally solved with HOCs can now be handled more elegantly and composably using custom hooks. Custom hooks are generally preferred for sharing stateful logic, while HOCs are still valid for scenarios involving component transformation or when you need to "wrap" the component rendering itself.

In modern React development, you'll often find custom hooks replacing HOCs for concerns like data fetching or form handling. However, HOCs remain a powerful pattern, especially in older codebases or when dealing with certain third-party libraries (like Redux's connect or Material-UI's withStyles, though these often have hook-based alternatives now).
