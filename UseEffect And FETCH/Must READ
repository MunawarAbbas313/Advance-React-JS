Okay, here's a short summary in points:

useEffect: React Hook for side effects (like data fetching).
fetch: JavaScript function to make API requests.
useEffect + fetch: Used to fetch data after a component renders.
Dependency Array ([]): Makes the fetch run only once (like componentDidMount).
State Management (useState): Tracks loading, errors, and fetched data.
Async/Await: Simplifies handling the asynchronous fetch Promise.
Conditional Rendering: Shows loading/error states or the fetched data.
Relation: useEffect manages the lifecycle for safe data fetching with fetch after rendering.
