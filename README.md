ðŸš€ Meta Advanced React Course Playground
Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to mastering Advanced React concepts and patterns from the Meta Advanced React Course!

This space serves as my hands-on lab, a structured collection of code examples, exercises, and notes as I dive deep into building robust, scalable, and highly performant React applications.

âœ¨ Why This Repository?
Learning Hub: Consolidating all my code examples and exercises from the course in one place.
Knowledge Base: Documenting key concepts, patterns, and best practices to reinforce learning.
Progress Tracker: A personal record of my journey through the advanced React curriculum.
Practical Application: Applying theoretical knowledge through practical coding challenges.
ðŸ“š What I'm Learning
The Meta Advanced React Course covers a wide array of sophisticated topics. Here are some of the key areas I'm exploring and practicing:

Advanced Component Design: Mastering patterns like Render Props, Higher-Order Components (HOCs), and Compound Components.
Context API & Reducers: Efficient and scalable state management without prop drilling.
Performance Optimization: Techniques such as React.memo, useCallback, useMemo, lazy loading, and code splitting.
Testing React Applications: In-depth unit and integration testing with Jest and React Testing Library.
Error Boundaries: Implementing robust error handling strategies for production applications.
Hooks Deep Dive: A comprehensive understanding and creation of custom Hooks for reusable logic.
... and many more advanced concepts to enhance my React development skills!
ðŸš€ Getting Started
To explore the code examples and exercises:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
(Remember to replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME with your actual GitHub details!)

Install dependencies:
Navigate into specific module folders (if they have their own package.json) and install dependencies:

Bash

cd src/module-name # e.g., cd src/performance-optimization
npm install        # or yarn install
Run examples:
Each module or example might have its own npm start or similar script. Check the individual package.json files within the module directories for specific instructions.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
The repository is organized by modules or topics as they are covered in the course. Each folder contains relevant code examples, exercises, and sometimes brief notes.
